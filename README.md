Getting Started is a tool that hopes to provide a short introduction to the PDE for new/beginner users. Much of the information is derived from the [**Getting Started Tutorial**](https://processing.org/tutorials/gettingstarted/) from the Processing website.

Users can flip through the frames using the **Previous** and **Next** buttons and can try examples in their own editors by using the **"Try It!"** button.

# Installation
You can install the Getting Started tool via the Contribution Manager in the PDE.
1. Tools > Add Tool...
2. Select "Getting Started" and press "Install"
